            <h4>On Meditation Process</h4>
            <div>
                <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
                <p>
                    I had to give up some ideas in the name of time boxing. In my opinion good process suggests timely delivery so this was something i had to keep mind.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h5> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
                <p>
                    The concept of meta attention and how it is the balancing act that lies at the core of meditating especially when it comes to beginners. I learnt that there is no such thing as bad meditation, even if you failed to not let your mind drift a 1000 times
                    and had to correct yourself a 1000 times, you already did very well and benefited your wellbing and happiness. <br> I like the idea of meditation being the exercise for the brain and the grandmother mind analogy.

                <h5> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
                <p>
                    I have dabbled in meditation before and was vaguely aware of everything I read in the chapter. The book however does provide an elegant summary that is tailored for IT workers and I like that it allows me to systemize my knowledge of meditation practices.

                <h5> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
                <p>
                    Nothing mindblowingly new in the techniques.Breathing and grandmother mind are good techniques however.

                <h5> Any other musings?</h5>
                <p>
                    Very keen to get my brain back to its default state and allow happiness to happen through meditation :)
