                <h5>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>
                <p>
                    When you are aware and mindful towards your emotional experience that is taking place, then you stand a chance of understanding yourself and managing the situation. The 'raging river' metaphor really tells it all. The moment you can see a raging river,
                    you are already rising above it. Thus seeing it is the first and an important step to the solution. Self awareness really is just emotional mindfulness. Where mindfulness is paying undivided attention to every single experience you
                    are having, i.e. focusing on task at hand, self awareness is like that but more centered around the emotional side of your existence and includes things like evaluating yourself, knowing your strengths and weaknesses and so on. It
                    really is knowing yourself in general as well as understanding yourself at the present moment, and that means being mindful to self.
                </p>
                <h5>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h5>

                <p>
                    I love journalling and writing for/about myself in general and I did not know this was a mindfulness practice but am very happy to find out it is. Journalling is rewarding in many ways as it is pretty much self awareness in writtent form, it allows for
                    small and big scale retrospective and it is fun.
                </p>
                <p>Body scan is a completely new exercise to me however. What I found when doing the body scan exercise is that my back is sore, my neck is sore and that means I will probably get a massage today.</p>
                <h5>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>
                <p>
                    What I got away is that emotions are just an experience. Similarly how you experience good weather and bad weather you experience a range of emotions from time to time. But it should not prevent you from being a good person and from studying javascript.
                    Because your emotions are not you :)
