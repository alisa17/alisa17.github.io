                <h5> How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>
                <p>
                    Life looks pretty good through the lens of all three provided:
                    <ul>
                        <li>purpose is the underlining driving force and core principle behind your actions</li>
                        <li>passion is the state which you enter when you are working on things that matter to you</li>
                        <li>rock-star pleasure is something you don't chase but indulge in occasionally but not too often you get sick of it and it loses its appeal</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h5>My core values include:</h5>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Freedom of expression and creativity</li>
                        <li>Professional and personal growth and progress: increasing standards for self and for quality of my work, becoming better than yesterday self</li>
                        <li>Acquiring practical knowledge and knowledge sharing</li>
                        <li>Love and kindness</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h5> What do you stand for?</h5>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Equality</li>
                        <li>Inclusion</li>
                        <li>Growth and progress</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h5> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>
                <p>
                    Being resilient to failure is important but I also feel doesn't require a lot of deep understanding as the concept is pretty easy to grasp and is a natural behaviour at least for me and many other people I know - if plan A fails you move on to plan B,
                    if that fails you start working on plan C. Never take it personally, never blame it on others - it's noone's fault, you did the best you could at the time, just move on to your next plan or look for new solutions and you should be
                    good.
                </p>
