                        <li> What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</li>
                        <p>I have experienced both compassionate and less so leadership. Environments with compassionate leaders are always healthier and result in higher standard of work performed by all involved.</p>
                        <li> Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</li>
                        <p>I found it lovely. Somewhat similar to loving kindness meditation in the sense that it gets you to think and connect with the rest of the sentient beings on the planet. Very lovely feeling.</p>
                        <li>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</li>
                        <p>I found it very good and at the same time it seemed to make sense. Where once was petty negativity there is now love.  
                        </p>
                        <li>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</li>
                        <p>With respect to Phase 0 it is mostly my own SCARF that I had to deal with. Constantly reminging myself that I am learning and ought to not get frustrated with self. Once I enter full time bootcamp I believe I will be mindful of other people's SCARF.</p>
                        <li>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</li>
                        <p>I had multiple difficult conversations within the past months and am still learning how to do it best. Being focused on the mutually beneficial outcome is something that helps me navigate the difficculty and remain on track during those conversations.</p>
