                <h5>That time i got blocked on a simple problem and that time I solved a problem in an elegant way</h5>
                <p>
                    Often times the only way for me to solve a problem in an elegant way is to first solve it in a non-elegant way when it comes to code. One time I was solving a coding problem and was delighted when it worked only to realise later how bad my code was and
                    cleaning it up felt good and elegant. The techniques I use when in trouble is to separate components as much as possible and try to get simple incremental parts to work. Also I always have pen and paper lying around handy to write
                    and draw when needed. Hand-writing and sketching really does help me.

                <h5>Problem solving techniques:</h5>

                    <h5>Pseudocode</h5>
                    <p>Pseudocode is a great tool to think about the future solution. Sometimes written out, sometimes just said outloud while typing code.</p>

                    <h5>Trying something</h5>
                    <p>Trying things is the best thing ever and even if the thing you are trying is not working, the chances are you learnt something while trying.</p>

                    <h5>Rubber ducky method</h5>
                    <p>Explaining the problem and the approaches you took to solve it and why they failed and how are a powerful method to problem solve. If you use a rubber ducky you don't have to take up other people's time.</p>

                    <h5> Reading error messages</h5>
                    <p>Error messages are great. I read them and sometimes they help. Other times they don't.</p>

                    <h5>Console.logging</h5>
                    <p>console.logging is pretty good to keep an eye on a variable or something. </p>

                    <h5>Googling</h5>
                    <p>I always google and sometimes it helps.</p>

                    <h5>Asking your peers for help</h5>
                    <p>This is my favourite, because you can ask real human questions if something doesn't quite make sense ton you and it can save you a lot of time.</p>

                    <h5>Asking coaches for help</h5>
                    <p>I haven't asked coaches for help yet. But I imagine it would be the same as peers but more experienced replies. At any rate asking real human for help is very effective and I like doing it because you can learn and solve much faster.</p>

                    <h5>Improving your process with reflection</h5>
                    <p>What worked and what didn't are the questions that drive improvement of every sprint. Reflection is a requirement and does help with the next sprint and understanding yourself and own dynamic.</p>

                    <h5>JS Array methods</h5>
                    <p>
                        <div class="row code">
                            .map()
                        </div>
                        method is an array method. What it does is apply some sort of (specified) action to an existing array's elements and produce a new array based on the action applied to every single element of the existing array.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <div class="row code">
                            .filter()
                        </div>
                        method is an array method. It applies a function to every element of the original array and returns only those elements that return the value 'true' as a result of the function application.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <div class="row code">
                             .reduce()
                        </div>
                        method is an array method. What it does is turn an array into a single value. The value is an operation performed on the elements of an array that you specify yourself.
                    </p>
