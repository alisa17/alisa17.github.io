                <h5> When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
                <p>
                    The biggest trigger for me when programming is the act of giving up. Sometimes I find myself unable to arrive at a solution, google a solution or the solution is otherwise not easily obtainable and I feel like I am running out of the allocated time box.
                    When that happens I usually "give up", move on and do something else. What triggers the negative response in me most is not the problem but the act of giving up. I remember about this unsolved problem throughout my day and feel very
                    negative towards myself. Usually I attempt it again later and succeed or change my approach and succeed.

                <h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h5>
                <p>
                    I beleive there is plenty to gain from this when it comes to a time of an emotional crisis. I wish I read this chapter slightly earlier as I did get very angry this week at a person. Thinking about it in retrospective the SBNRR technique would have been perfect at that moment.
