                        <p>
                            Responsive site is the kind of website that responds to how the user is chosing to access it. Responsive website looks equally accessible on a smart phone screen, on a tablet screen and on a desktop. User doesn't have to go through the inconvenience of
                            zooming or unnecessary scrolling to access all the key functionality of a responsive website. In other words, responsive websites are convenient and pleasant user experience regardless the device.

                        <h5> What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h5>
                        <p>
                            Frameworks are a set of design rules, guidelines and concepts created by someone else and made available for you to use. Cons of frameworks is that you need to put some effort and analysis in order to decide what sort of framework you or your team need
                            for tackling a particular project. Once you do however settle upon an appropriate framework it is likely to make your collaboration easier and the speed at which you work faster as you will all be using the same concepts and
                            structures for the project most basic needs. Provided good choice of framework, it should allow you plenty of room to customise as well.

                        <h5> What mobile first design is, and why it's important. </h5>
                        <p>
                            A lot of people carry out a lot of their day to day activities through their smart phone these days. Paying bills, doing work or browsing internet for leisure. This in turn leads to a design philosphy that advocates first making sure that the site works
                            well on a mobile phone screen.

                        <h5>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h5>
                        <p>
                            Wireframe is a high level layout of a webpage, usually consisting of boxes and blocks. Wireframes are important as they dictate the design decisions and how elements relate to each other on a webpage.

                    Scrollbars and enlarged pictures haven't been implemented this week due to time constraints, hope to practice with these elements next week. Here are the original wireframes sketched for this website in the beginning of the week:
