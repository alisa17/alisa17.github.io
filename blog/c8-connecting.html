                    <h5>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h5>
                    <p>I have not tried these particulat techniques in work environement. Trust and sincerity however are my default states when it comes to work as transparency of this sort is objectively most productive strategy to get things done and
                        learn something along the way.</p>
                    <h5>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>
                    <p>It was a rewarding experience similarly to the mindful listening exercise but harder. I wasn't always accurate in determining what the feeling was that the other party was experiencing. There is no way to know all the subtlties of how another person is feeling without being super super mindful and even then you stil might not know exactly how they feel. But if you pay attention then you stand a chance at truly understanding another person. I don't know if I will practice it throughout my personal and professional life a lot. I think that if you live and work mindfully then you might not need to strategically do the empathetic listening exercise. But it is a good technique to have in your tool set for when understanding is hard to reach. </p>
                    <h5>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>
                    <p>I throughly enjoy the loving kindness meditation. I feel happy and grateful and very much in tune with the outside world. I would definitely consider adding this to my timetable on a once a week basis.</p>
