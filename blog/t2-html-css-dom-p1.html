            <h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4> HTML is like furniture inside a room. While CSS is like the designer who comes in and says we put this rag here on this angle, we put the table here and also let's paint this wall purple. <br> DOM could be described as a well organised wardrobe.
