    <h1>Personal Reflections</h1>
    <p>
        I envision EDA experience to be fun, challenging and mind opening. I intend to learn and make friends, embrace best practice and develop good technical and soft-skill habits.

        I feel like the culture is in line with my personal preferences for learning and I am definitely excited to participate. I am curious as to what kind of person I will come out as on the other end both professionally and otherwise.
