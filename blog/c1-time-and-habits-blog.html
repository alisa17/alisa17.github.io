            Time boxing technique is something that I like and tend to gravitate to. There is a limited number of hours in a day and often my friends or coworkers and I decide to catch up in an hour and see how we go on completing a task. This allows to reflect and
            address problems if any arise before the end of the day.

            Because I don't like to stay up late I am going to try one of the unexpected advices which was to aim to finish key tasks by noon. Giving yourself less time is apparently a time management technique. I expect it might work for me because I am also an
            obvious lark.
