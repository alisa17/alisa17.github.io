                <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
                <p>
                  What I learnt is that oftentimes we don't give each oher anywhere near as much attention as we deserve when it comes to listening. I ejoyed being the listener and having my attention 100% absorbed into what my partner was saying. I am convinced mindful conversation is rewarding to either party and I am going to try it again with a variety of people I might be talking to. I do think that not paying attention while conversing is really robbing yourself of the experience that is human interaction and I want for all of my conversations to be as mindful of possible from this point on.

                <h5>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>
                <p>Definiyely and without doubt walking meditation has a place in my life alerady, more so it is often jogging meditation. I stumbled upon it accidentally runnning in the park years ago and reading this chapter helped me to systemize my unerstanding of the mechanics behind it. I want to aim to have more walking meditations not only when I run but as I walk to work during the next month. </p>
